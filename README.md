# autonomous-api-optimizer

A Spring Boot application that autonomously monitors API performance, detects anomalies (e.g., high latency), and applies optimizations (e.g., thread pool tuning, caching). This project demonstrates real-time monitoring, performance optimization, and modern DevOps practices


Features

REST API with mock data (e.g., /api/orders).

Metrics with Micrometer and Prometheus.

Dashboards in Grafana.

Caching with Redis.

Alerts via Kafka.

Threshold-based optimization (e.g., latency > 500ms).
